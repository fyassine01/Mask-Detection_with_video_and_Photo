This project uses deep learning models (e.g., CNN and ResNet/Inception) to detect whether people are wearing face masks in real-time or on images and videos. The models are trained to classify faces into two categories: **"Mask"** and **"No Mask"**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Detects faces and classifies them as wearing a mask or not.
- 📷 Supports static image analysis (`detect_mask_image.py`).
- 🎥 Supports real-time video or webcam input (`detect_mask_video.py`).
- 🧠 Trained deep learning models included (`mask_detector.model`).
- 🎯 Uses OpenCV for face detection and TensorFlow/Keras for mask classification.
- 🖼️ Compatible with pre-trained face detectors like `deploy.prototxt` and `res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel`.
